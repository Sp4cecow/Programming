Importing game-development and graphics libraries for your Snake game starts with some important libraries such as Pygame. The game starts Pygame and configures screen, block size, and framerate. It defines helper functions to produce food and obstacles without them colliding with the snake or one another. All the colors in game components are given in RGB values. The initializer function of the game loop first sets variables to the game state, like snake initial position and direction of movement. It checks for inputs from the player, and updates the state of the game (shows the snake, the food, the challenges, and the score). The difficulty level increases over time and it increases in difficulty and speed. After every level, random colors are given to the snake and food. Game checks for collisions with walls, obstacles, itself, etc and crashes if anything gets hit. – Game loop also gives you the option to re-open or quit the game when the game is over for a great playing experience. The game continues until the user quits, at which point Pygame is closed correctly.

To get the Snake game up and running, ok, first off you’ll want to make sure Python's hanging out on your computer along with Pygame. Alright, if Pygame isn’t chilling there yet, go ahead and pop open your command prompt or terminal. Just a little thing here—you can punch in pip install pygame and it should sort that right out for you. Once that's squared away more or less, take all the lines of game code and just throw them into a fresh Python file; let's say you call it something like snake_game.py for instance. So now comes the fun part—open up a terminal or command prompt again. Anyway, move yourself over to where that Python file is saved by using some basic navigation commands. Now type python snake_game.py into your command line thingy and hit Enter real quick! You know what happens next? A window pops up with your Snake game. As you progress and score points, the game will get progressively harder with increased speed and additional obstacles. If you encounter any issues, check the terminal for error messages to troubleshoot and make necessary adjustments to the code. Happy gaming
